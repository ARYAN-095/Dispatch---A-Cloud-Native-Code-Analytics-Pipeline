# Dispatch - A Cloud-Native Code Analytics 

A service that analyzes public GitHub repositories on-demand. Users submit a repository URL, and the system performs a series of analyses (e.g., security vulnerability scan, complexity calculation, dependency analysis) via a distributed, asynchronous pipeline, presenting a beautiful report at the end.
